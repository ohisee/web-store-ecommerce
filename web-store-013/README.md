Converted several components into using styled component<br />
Updated "react-scripts" to 4.0.0 version. This version appears not allowing require("../..") lookup, so moved images file into public folder and removed require("../..") lookup, just locate by relative path. Also included <em>"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true</em> in tsconfig.json file.<br />
